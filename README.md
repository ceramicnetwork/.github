# Ceramic Protocol
> [**Ceramic**](http://ceramic.network) is a permissionless protocol for creating unstoppable documents that serve as the foundation for a connected, interoperable web without silos. 

Ceramic's public infrastructure allows participants to create signed, append-only, tamper-proof documents that act as a censorship-resistant and universally available source of truth for important information. Ceramic documents are stored in [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs), encoded using [IPLD](https://github.com/ipld/ipld), and anchored in one or more blockchains. Because Ceramic's Universal Document Graph is public, permissionless, and verifiable, it unlocks information access and interoperability between *all platforms and services across the web*.

Although Ceramic can be used to store any kind of signed information, it is well-suited as a universal routing layer for storing decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and their associated metadata, data schemas, policies for usage of web services, access control permissions, and other documents that collectively enable boundless interoperability between an ecosystem of connected wallets, applications, databases, and services.

Together, Ceramic documents give users more control and interoperability over their identity, information, and resources, and allow developers to build composable apps with unprecedented modulariity, trust, and scale.

### Start building

Ceramic is currently live with the Slip testnet that anchors document updates on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet. You can view the current Ceramic roadmap [here](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/issues/19).

## Implementatons

| Package | JavaScript | Description |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Ceramic | [ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic) | Typescript implementation of the Ceramic protocol |

> Want to work on an implementation in another language? [Open an issue](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/issues) in this repository to discuss it with others, find help, and coordinate efforts.

## Contributing

### Report bugs and/or issues

To report a bug or issue with code, open a new Github issue on the affected repository.

### Propose improvements and/or standards 

[Ceramic Improvement Proposals (CIPs)](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/cip) is a process used to propose improvements to the core Ceramic protocol or use case standards. Create a Ceramic Improvement Proposal (CIP) by opening a new issue in the [ceramicnetwork/CIP](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues) repository.

To propose or contribute other feature requests or improvements that don't fit neatly into the above, such as creating an implementation in another language, open an issue in the [ceramicnetwork/ceramic](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/issues) repository.

### Create or join working groups

The [Ceramic Ecosystem Alliance (CEA)](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CEA) is a grassroots organization that allows community members to self-organize into topic-based working groups. These working groups allow members to closely collaborate on important issues and produce meaningful outcomes, often in the form of [CIPs](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP) with wide buy-in from the community. The CEA meets every two weeks, and individual working groups meet on their own schedule. [Click here](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CEA#join-the-cea) to join the CEA and get access to the calendar.
